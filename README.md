#### Problems in Existing Solutions

- Little Less user friendly for maybe not so literate people
- Complicated Process - Blue Collars dont have a resume.
- Longer waiting Periods for both applicant and employer.
- All in English
- Lack of Support on chat/call

## Workflow

I have identified 9 categories of job-seekers to make the platform more intuitive and simple.

- Electrician
- Plumber
- Labour
- Driver
- Maid
- Security guard
- Cook
- Peon
- Mechanic

### For Job Seeker

1. Register
2. Update Profile
3. Apply on jobs - just by clicking - as simple as that.
4. The applicant gets an SMS on his/her phone number after applying to a job.

### For Job Poster

1. Post Jobs
2. Get applications on your posted jobs and shortlist.
3. **Ease the flow** for both parties
   - Job Seekers Profiles will be available all throughout, Recruiters can directly see their profiles and give them a message/call
4. Job Poster gets an email when someone applies on a job posted by him/her.

## Project Structure

We will structure our application using the controller, service, and, manager pattern so our app will be broken into the managers, services, and controllers. The `Manager-Service-Controller` pattern breaks up the business layer of the app into three distinct layers:

1. The `manager class` handles getting data into and out of our data store. A manager is used between the service layer and the model layer. For example, in the UserManager you would create methods that write/read a user to and from the database.
2. The `service class` calls the manager class and can combine their data to form new, more complex business objects. It is an abstraction between the controller and the manager.
3. A `controller` contains very little logic and is used to make calls to services.

### [Pending Tasks](https://github.com/Manvityagi/Rozgaar-Blue-Collars-Job-Seach-Platform-Backend/blob/main/tests.md)

- Unit Tests - Due to shortage of time, I couldn't write many unit-test.
- Login Sessions and Dashboard of Applications

### Loophole in current solution

1. Hiding unavailable jobs/users

- Problem: The major problem in current solution is lack of mechanism of deleting jobs that have been filled and hiding job-seeker profiles who have already got a job
- Solution: This is easy to solve once user-sessions for both employer and applicant are created, on their
  dashboards, we can give the option to hide thier job/profile.

2. Verification of jobs/profiles

- Problem: The portal can be spammed with fake jobs/profiles.
- Solution: Verifying user-identity by Aadhar Number Verification/phone number verifcation.

### Additional Features to be added after Hackathon:

- Multi-lingual
- Filters according to location, salary etc.
- Stars/Reviews for job seekers
- Register by calling also (for job seekers) - simply call on a support number and automated clicks on phone

### Reaching Target Audience

- Awareness of the existence of a solution holds utmost importance.
- The first point of contact could be several NGOs - Lakshyam, Hand in Hand India, The /Nudge Foundation etc.
- The Internet is not something that Blue-Collar Workers don't use, Promotional Ads are the way to go.
- Referral System for both Employer and Seeker.
